# Face-Recognition-System-for-Criminal-Identification
A face recognition system for identifying criminals in images. This system uses the Face Recognition library and OpenCV for image processing, and implements a GUI for image selection using Tkinter.
This project presents a comprehensive face recognition system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify criminals in images. 
By harnessing the power of the Face Recognition library and OpenCV, the system efficiently processes images and extracts valuable information. 
A face repository with encoded faces is created, and a user-friendly GUI is implemented using Tkinter, allowing for seamless image selection. 
The system's classification function expertly compares unknown face encodings to known face encodings, yielding accurate matches. 
The classified image is then displayed with rectangles and text labels, clearly indicating the names of the faces.

This project showcases a range of skills, including machine learning and computer vision, image processing using OpenCV, GUI development using Tkinter, face recognition and classification, and criminal identification and detection. 

# Future Development 
While the system has achieved successful detection and identification of criminal faces, there is still room for refinement and scaling. 
Future improvements could include expanding the face repository to enhance accuracy, implementing real-time face recognition for improved efficiency, integrating with a database for storing and retrieving criminal records, implementing user authentication for secure access, and developing a mobile application for on-the-go criminal identification. 
Overall, this project demonstrates the ability to develop and improve a complex face recognition system for criminal identification.
